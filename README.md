dewbrew
=======
This project creates a web-based controller for homebrewing beer on an electric brewery. The controller uses an Ardruino Uno for control of relays and temperature sensing. A Raspberry Pi, with a wireless dongle, provides the web front end. Here are the key features:
* automated filling, pumping, and draining of HLT, mash, and boil kettles
* PID temperature controls, and temperature-based state switching
* web-based interface to control brewing parameters
* interface with camera for remote monitoring of brewing process
* cheap! ~$100 for the hardware, excluding higher-powered SSRs / relays for heating elements and solenoids
